It&amp;rsquo;s that time of year again when many of us make resolutions with the hope of improving ourselves and our lives. Last year, I made three resolutions and I&amp;rsquo;m proud to say that I achieved two of them.
One of my resolutions was to write a minimum of 12 posts on this blog in 2023, or one post per month. This is a goal that I am determined to achieve as writing and sharing my thoughts and experiences is something that I enjoy and find fulfilling.</description></item><item><title>Welcome to 2023!!</title><link>/posts/2023-01-03-welcome-2023/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2023 21:26:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2023-01-03-welcome-2023/</guid><description>
