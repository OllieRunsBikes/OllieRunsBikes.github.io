One of my resolutions was to write a minimum of 12 posts on this blog in 2023, or one post per month. This is a goal that I am determined to achieve as writing and sharing my thoughts and experiences is something that I enjoy and find fulfilling."><meta name=keywords content><meta name=robots content="noodp"><link rel=canonical href=/posts/2023-01-05-resolutions-for-2023/><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/style.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/style.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon-precomposed sizes=144x144 href=/img/apple-touch-icon-144-precomposed.png><link rel="shortcut icon" href=/img/favicon.png><link href=/fonts/Inter-Italic.woff2 rel=preload type=font/woff2 as=font crossorigin><link href=/fonts/Inter-Regular.woff2 rel=preload type=font/woff2 as=font crossorigin><link href=/fonts/Inter-Medium.woff2 rel=preload type=font/woff2 as=font crossorigin><link href=/fonts/Inter-MediumItalic.woff2 rel=preload type=font/woff2 as=font crossorigin><link href=/fonts/Inter-Bold.woff2 rel=preload type=font/woff2 as=font crossorigin><link href=/fonts/Inter-BoldItalic.woff2 rel=preload type=font/woff2 as=font crossorigin><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="New Years Resolutions for 2023"><meta name=twitter:description content="It&rsquo;s that time of year again when many of us make resolutions with the hope of improving ourselves and our lives.

I have always had a passion for web development and design, and bringing one of my ideas to life would be a huge accomplishment for me.</p><p>My third resolution was to run smarter, not longer. While I do enjoy running and the feeling of accomplishment it brings, I also recognize the importance of pacing myself and not pushing myself too hard. By focusing on running smarter, I hope to be able to continue enjoying this activity for years to come.</p><p>Overall, I am proud of the progress I made with my resolutions last year and I am excited to see what the new year brings. Here&rsquo;s to a successful and fulfilling 2023!</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=/posts/2023-01-06-dealing-with-negative-feedback-as-a-developer/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
