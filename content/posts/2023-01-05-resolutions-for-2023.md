It's that time of year again when many of us make resolutions with the hope of improving ourselves and our lives. Last year, I made three resolutions and I'm proud to say that I achieved two of them.

One of my resolutions was to write a minimum of 12 posts on this blog in 2023, or one post per month. This is a goal that I am determined to achieve as writing and sharing my thoughts and experiences is something that I enjoy and find fulfilling.

Another resolution I made was to put one of my web site ideas live. I have always had a passion for web development and design, and bringing one of my ideas to life would be a huge accomplishment for me.

My third resolution was to run smarter, not longer. While I do enjoy running and the feeling of accomplishment it brings, I also recognize the importance of pacing myself and not pushing myself too hard. By focusing on running smarter, I hope to be able to continue enjoying this activity for years to come.

Overall, I am proud of the progress I made with my resolutions last year and I am excited to see what the new year brings. Here's to a successful and fulfilling 2023!
